# Coursera_Machine_Learning
Machine Learning Projects completed as part of Stanford's Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew Ng. <br/>
Ex1 covers Linear Regression with multiple variables <br/>
Ex2 covers Logistic Regression for binary classification <br/>
Ex3 covers MultiClass Classification and Neural Networks <br/>
Ex4 covers more Neural Networks and System Design <br/>
Ex5 covers Support Vector Machines <br/>
Ex6 covers Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering and PCA) <br/>
Ex7 covers Hybrid Systems such as Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems <br/>

See the PDFs in each Ex for more information. Code was written in Octave but will work in Matlab too.
